Training an agent to navigate a maze using Meta Reinforcement Learning techniques

Working on implementing a Simple Neural Attentive Meta Learner (SNAIL) Mishra, - Nikhil, et al. "A simple neural attentive meta-learner." arXiv preprint arXiv:1707.03141 (2017). https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.03141

Using PPO instead of TRPO GAE as in the original paper

- Working on the training loop. May choose to implement my own PPO logic if cherry-rl does not work out in my favour!
