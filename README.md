!!WORK IN PROGRESS!!

NOTE - The original metamaze https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/MetaGym/tree/master/metagym/metamaze uses Gym which is no longer supported. I've adapted the discrete 3d maze for gymnasium and it has some more changes to enable the agent to carry over memory across trials.

Training an agent to navigate a maze using Meta Reinforcement Learning techniques

Working on implementing a Simple Neural Attentive Meta Learner (SNAIL) Mishra, - Nikhil, et al. "A simple neural attentive meta-learner." arXiv preprint arXiv:1707.03141 (2017). https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.03141

Using PPO instead of TRPO GAE as in the original paper

- Working on the training loop. May choose to implement my own PPO logic if cherry-rl does not work out in my favour!
